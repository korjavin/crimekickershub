# Continuity Ledger

## Goal (incl. success criteria):
Build Crime Kickers Hub - a Go-based web application with:
- Public CMS for comic book universe
- Internal "Prompt Studio" for managing Generative AI workflows
- SQLite database with WAL mode
- Type-safe data access via sqlc
- Prompt versioning and composition engine
- Cloudflare R2 integration for image storage
- YouTube integration for video links

## Constraints/Assumptions:
- Go 1.25.5, module: crimekickershub
- SQLite with WAL mode (no external DB)
- Google OAuth 2.0 with admin whitelist
- Cloudflare R2 for image storage
- YouTube for video hosting

## Key decisions:
- Use sqlc for type-safe SQL queries (not gorm/raw SQL)
- Prompts are never overwritten - version increment on update
- Media assets link to prompt_version_id for traceability
- Stories contain ordered StoryItems (images/video links)

## State:
4 tasks completed out of 7

## Done:
- Task 1: Project Initialization & Database Schema
  - Go module initialized (crimekickershub)
  - SQLite DB with WAL mode configured
  - 7 tables: entities, prompt_types, prompt_versions, media_assets, stories, story_items, users

- Task 2: Data Access Layer (SQLC)
  - sqlc.yaml configured for SQLite
  - 30+ queries in sql/queries/queries.sql
  - Generated repository package with interfaces

- Task 3: Prompt Engine Service
  - PromptService with ComposePrompt, SaveNewVersion, GetPromptDiff
  - Unit tests for version increment logic
  - go-diff library for text comparison

- Task 4: Media Service & Cloudflare R2
  - R2Client with UploadImage and UploadImageFromPath
  - MediaService with RegisterAsset for image/video assets
  - YouTube URL parsing (ExtractYouTubeID, IsYouTubeURL)
  - Helper functions for embeds and thumbnails

## Now:
Task 4 completed. Ready to move to Task 5.

## Next:
Task 5: Story & StoryItems API (likely)

## Open questions (UNCONFIRMED if needed):
- Need to clarify API design for Story builder

## Working set (files/ids/commands):
- internal/service/media/media.go
- internal/storage/r2.go
- go build ./...
- go test ./...
